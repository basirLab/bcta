    "CT1": [
      "Misinterprets the question or responds off-topic, showing confusion or lack of clarity.",
      "Understands the surface meaning but misses key elements or misrepresents the core idea.",
      "Understands the key message and restates the question meaningfully with some contextual grasp.",
      "Clearly restates the prompt in original wording, capturing both core and implicit meanings, including assumptions and context."
    ],
    "CT2": [
      "No clear structure; claims, evidence, and reasoning are mixed or absent.",
      "Distinguishes some elements (e.g., claim vs. evidence) but with weak or unclear connections.",
      "Separates key components and attempts to show their logical relationships.",
      "Breaks down information precisely into structured parts and maps out strong logical relationships between them."
    ],
    "CT3": [
      "No attempt to assess the quality or relevance of the information.",
      "Mentions evidence but lacks critical analysis or judgment of its credibility.",
      "Evaluates at least one piece of evidence with justified reasoning.",
      "Compares multiple pieces of evidence, judging credibility and relevance using clear evaluation criteria."
    ],
    "CT4": [
      "Conclusion is missing, invalid, or disconnected from the information.",
      "A conclusion is given but relies on assumptions or contains logical gaps.",
      "Draws a valid conclusion based on provided information.",
      "Constructs a logically sound conclusion from multiple sources, while addressing possible counterarguments."
    ],
    "CT5": [
      "Disorganized, vague, or hard to follow; lacks coherence.",
      "Basic structure exists but lacks clarity or logical progression.",
      "Uses a clear structure (e.g., intro–body–conclusion) with mostly coherent explanation.",
      "Highly coherent and structured argument; communicates reasoning effectively for reader understanding."
    ],
    "CT6": [
      "Shows no reflection or awareness of possible errors.",
      "Acknowledges possible errors but without depth or clarity.",
      "Recognizes limitations and addresses them with brief reflection.",
      "Actively identifies weaknesses or flaws in reasoning and explains how they were considered or addressed."
